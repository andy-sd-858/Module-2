 Module 2 Challenge Assignment
Hi, in this assignment I have created my own personal portfolio.
I did the best I could to satisfy the requirements.
It is not a perfect webpage but I tried my best.
The questions I have are, how do you make it so when you click on an image it pops up bigger.
I know the webpage could look nicer, but my brain was not being creative.
I also wanted to know how to make my links in a straight line instead them being stacked on top of each other.
Other than that I hope you enjoy looking at my webpage.
